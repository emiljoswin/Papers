# Papers
This is a collection of papers that I have read deeply. I believe in taking handwritten notes which enables me to think 
and articulate the authors points very well. Also, it helps me draw out the authors ideas and sometimes couple them mine.

The notes contains the authors points, my counter points, my questions and some ideas and criticisms.

Reading papers have helped me gain clarity over a lot of ideas that I thought I knew. So, one day I decided to keep
permament record of my notes on the internet and hence this repo.
