# Papers
This is a collection of papers that I have read deeply. I believe in taking handwritten notes because it enables me to think and articulate the authors points very well. Also, you can quickly represent an idea in the form of drawings.

The notes may contain the author's points, my points, my questions and some ideas and criticisms.
